<h2>Q-7.  How can you use Bootstrap to make thumbnails?</h2>
<Strong>Answer</Strong>: <br> Web designers can utilise Bootstrap to create thumbnails that are used to display connected photographs in grids with pre-defined classes, reducing the length of the coding. Thumbnails were created to provide viewers with a short sample of photography using small images. <br>

A thumbnail is a little image that is used to represent a larger image. This is made simple using Bootstrap's thumbnails. Bootstrap's.thumbnail class is used to display related pictures in grids (grid system). Within the element a>, class.thumbnail is used to generate a thumbnail. To arrange photos into grids, the classes.col-sm-* and.col-md-*, where * denotes a number, are used. <br>
<strong>Step-by-step instructions for implementation :</strong> <br>
Step 1: Include Bootstrap and jQuery CDN in the head> tag before any other stylesheets to load our CSS. <br>

Step 2: In the HTML body, insert a div> tag with the class row. To make four photos, divide the "div" into four div portions.
<br>
Step 3: Add "col-sm-6" and "col-md-3" to four div elements to make a webpage responsive.
<br>
Step 4: In the next line, add an a> tag with the class thumbnail to define the link to the image. <br>
